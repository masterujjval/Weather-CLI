## For Linux

Give the required permission to the scripts by using the command ```chmod +x *```. Then, execute the ```setup.sh``` script by executing the command ```./setup.sh```.

The ```setup.sh``` script will copy the files to one of the directories included in the PATH. So, you can execute the script directly from the terminal using the command:

```weather```
